venue:
    header-1: How to Get Here
    body-1: Madison (pop. ~272k) is the capital of Wisconsin and the home of University of Wisconsin's flagship campus. The conference will be held at the Monona Terrace--a beautiful conference venue designed by Frank Lloyd Wright on the shores of Lake Monona. 
    header-2: Facilities & Accommodations
    body-2: We welcome you to the vibrant City of Madison. We invite you to take 
            advantage of this time away from your daily lives to catch up on the latest
            developments in the field and to deepen your appreciation of the amazing
            research being done in the language evolution community. We also invite you to
            consider how our work may be a force for positive change back in the real world.
            We hope you will take us up on these invitations--in the conference hall,
            at the lively Union Terrace, at the Saturday farmer’s market on the Capitol Square, and
            at the many fine eating and drinking establishments nearby.

        - text: Fly to Madison
          fa-icon: fa-plane-departure
          body: We recommend flying into Dane County Regional Airport (MSN) which has nonstop flights to many major cities around the country and has the benefit of being just 10 minutes from downtown Madison. From MSN, you can get to downtown using a taxi, Uber, or Lyft.

        - text: Fly to Milwaukee 
          fa-icon: fa-plane-departure
          body: Another option is to fly to Milwaukee (MKE), a slightly larger airport, about 80 miles East of Madison. Milwaukee has more flights and depending on your origin may be cheaper. There's a direct bus from MKE to Madison, but make sure to check the bus schedule first.

        - text: Fly to Chicago
          fa-icon: fa-plane-departure
          body: Another option, which may make sense if you're traveling internationally, is to fly to Chicago's O'Hare airport (ORD, about 130 miles Southeast of Madison) and take a bus to Madison (~3hrs, but is sometimes faster than connecting to a flight to Madison).
