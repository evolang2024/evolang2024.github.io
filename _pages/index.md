    header: Conference Details
    subheader: "EVOLANG is the largest international meeting for researchers working on the origin and evolution of language. The conference is highly interdisciplinary, with contributions from disciplines including, but not limited to: anthropology, archeology, biology, cognitive science, genetics, linguistics, computational modeling (including mathematical, agent-based, and neural-network models), paleontology, physiology, primatology, philosophy, semiotics, and psychology. Typically, about 300 delegates attend, with representatives from all these disciplines.<br>
        <br>The conference language will be English. We will have ASL interpreters on hand for providing interpreting to/from ASL (other sign languages may be a possibility) To gauge demand for interpreting services, please <a href = 'https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSejSkSKxD1BEndXDIARr75xI4p1KBpa7GBAZskD_lJnzuJP8g/viewform'><b>complete this survey</b></a> if you think you could benefit from sign language interpreting.

venue:
    header-1: Welcome to Madison!
    body-1: Madison (pop. ~272k) is the capital of Wisconsin and the home of <A HREF='https://www.wisc.edu/'>University of Wisconsin's flagship campus</A>. The conference will be held at the <A HREF='https://www.mononaterrace.com/'>Monona Terrace</A>--a beautiful conference venue designed by Frank Lloyd Wright on the shores of Lake Monona. We invite you to take advantage of this time away from your daily lives to catch up on the latest developments in the field and to deepen your appreciation of the amazing research being done in the language evolution community. We also invite you to consider how our work may be a force for positive change back in the real world. We hope you will take us up on these invitations--in the conference hall, at the lively Union Terrace, at the Saturday farmer’s market on the Capitol Square, and at the many fine eating and drinking establishments nearby. We will also be planning several excursions after the main conference. 
    header-2: Accommodations
    body-2: We have pre-booked room blocks at several  hotels within short walking distance to the conference venue. You can reserve a room at <A HREF='https://www.hilton.com/en/book/reservation/deeplink/?ctyhocn=MSNMHHF&groupCode=EVO24&arrivaldate=2024-05-17&departuredate=2024-05-22&cid=OM,WW,HILTONLINK,EN,DirectLink&fromId=HILTONLINKDIRECT'>Hilton Monona Terrace</A> or call Hilton Reservtions at 800-445-8667 or the hotel directlry at 608-255-5100 and reference the group code EVO24. An alternative is <A HREF='https://www.bestwestern.com/en_US/book/hotel-rooms.50061.html?groupId=1E9CV2N0'>Park Hotel Madison</A>. Both hotels offer single and double rooms for the same price. The <A HREF='https://uwmadison.eventsair.com/evolang-xv/registration'>registration page</A> has a option to indicate that you are interested in sharing a double room with a fellow attendee. Registered attendees will get a link to a spreadsheet for facilitating room-sharing.

        - text: Fly to Madison
          fa-icon: fa-plane-departure
          body: We recommend flying into Dane County Regional Airport (MSN) which has nonstop flights to many major cities around the country and has the benefit of being just 10 minutes from downtown Madison. From MSN, you can get to downtown using a taxi, Uber, or Lyft.
          link: MSN &rarr;

        - text: Fly to Milwaukee 
          fa-icon: fa-plane-departure
          body: Another option is to fly to Milwaukee (MKE), a slightly larger airport, about 80 miles East of Madison. Milwaukee has more flights and depending on your origin may be cheaper. There's a direct bus from MKE to Madison, but make sure to check the bus schedule first.

        - text: Fly to Chicago
          fa-icon: fa-plane-departure
          body: Another option, which may make sense if you're traveling internationally, is to fly to Chicago's O'Hare airport (ORD, about 130 miles Southeast of Madison) and take a bus to Madison (~3hrs, but is sometimes faster than connecting to a flight to Madison).
