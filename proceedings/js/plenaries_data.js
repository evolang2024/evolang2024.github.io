        "abstract": "Evolutionary linguistics is not just about the evolution of structures, it is also about language vitality, an umbrella term about language birth, vibrance, resilience, endangerment, and death. It conjures up population movements and language contact within specific population structures, with the latter rolling the dice not only on how forms and structures are selected from a joint feature pool into and out of new language varieties but also on which languages prevail, remain vibrant or resilient, or vanish in particular social ecologies.\nIn the face of linguistic diversity, we probably will never know how many languages were spoken among humans by the time of the Exodus out of Africa. On the other hand, the known history of human migrations, including imperial/colonial expansions, has made obvious that language birth and death have occurred repeatedly. This history makes it imperative for us to investigate the ecological conditions under which these processes have occurred and to assess the current claim that the number of languages has been dramatically decreasing compared to earlier stages of human history.\nThinking of languages as technologies can we explain why some populations give up their languages and whether users or the situations leading them to such shifts should be blamed or pitied for doing so? Is language shift maladaptive? Is it different from other kinds of technology shifts, including religion, health practices, diets, and clothing, among a host of other folk technologies?",

        "abstract": "Worldwide patterns of genetic variation are driven by human demographic history. In several contexts, we have tested whether this demographic history has left similar signatures on languages to those it has left on genes. Globally, we found a geographic pattern in which populations that were closer to one another tended to be more similar genetically and linguistically. Our analyses suggested that two processes influence this pattern: vertical transmission of both genes and languages during the peopling of the world, and linguistic borrowing (often coupled with genetic admixture) when neighboring populations come into contact, even when their languages are very different. We then build on these findings in multiple contexts. We explore whether sex-biased patterns in human history affect genetic and cultural evolution, by merging genetic, linguistic, and ethnographic data to study the potentially differing signatures of maternal and paternal transmission. We conduct in-depth genetic and linguistic analyses of dialect-level variation within England, and we use similar data to better understand the formation of Sranan, a Creole language in Suriname. Finally, we examine features of Creole languages more broadly to understand how they form and evolve, as well as whether these patterns are reflected in signatures of genetic admixture. Jointly studying linguistic and genetic variation at multiple levels can give us a more nuanced understanding of human evolution and diversity.",
