        "summary": "Like any field of research, language evolution research is in constant flux. As such, it seems promising to find bottom-up answers on what is seen as central, and what as more peripheral, in current language evolution research. In this paper, we draw on submission data from the Joint Conference on Language Evolution 2022 to address this question in more detail. We combine an analysis of submission numbers per topic and review scores (consisting of overall scores and relevance ratings) with a bottom-up, data-driven approach that uses quantitative text mining methods to detect \"communities\" in the JCoLE submissions based on 150-word abstracts like the one you are currently reading. In sum, our results lend further support to previous scientometric studies that have shown that language evolution research is a highly interdisciplinary field whose members particularly value empirical work targeting fairly broad-scope research questions with a special focus on cultural evolution.",

        "summary": "One reason that languages come to have the properties they do is because those properties make a language easier to learn, its rules easier to generalise. In an artificial language learning experiment, we investigate which statistical properties of a language help people to decide whether a linguistic rule can be extended to new instances. In line with previous empirical results, we find that rules are more readily generalised when they apply to items that follow a skewed frequency distribution or when they apply to more distinct item types. These results are not compatible with previous explanations of rule generalisation that are based solely on Shannon entropy. We propose instead that the explanation follows from participants reasoning in a probabilistic, Bayesian way, and that ultimately, probabilistic reasoning of the kind we observe may shape the statistical structure of language.",

        "summary": "Linguistic phylogenies are standardly inferred from lexical cognate relationships (e.g., Bouckaert et al. 2012, Chang et al. 2015, Sagart et al. 2019). Despite the prevalence of this practice, it suffers from well-known drawbacks. First, it disregards the phylogenetic signal that exists in the form of the words themselves. Second, it limits the modeling possibilities since it relies on an arbitrary coding of the data. In this talk, I introduce a novel framework for linguistic phylogenetics that overcomes both of these shortcomings. The heart of this framework is the TKF91 model (Thorne et al. 1991), which allows phylogenetic inference to be carried out directly from cognate word-forms. This model not only opens up a new horizon in the study of linguistic phylogenetics, but allows historical linguists to investigate questions of sound change that were previously out of reach.",

        "summary": "Languages make consistent and deliberate use of a relatively narrow set of contrastive speech sounds (phonemes). We argue that phonological systems constitute cognitive tools, supporting, guiding, and extending speaker cognitive capacities. We make several claims toward this point. First, compared with the communication systems of nonhuman animals, the consistent and socially deliberated use and reuse of phonemes enables rapid information transmission rates through syllabic speech. Second, native-language input provides developing human infants with acoustic-perceptual goals, the replication or quasi-replication of which, serve as a marker of emergent social consciousness and identity. Third, exposure to systems of speech sounds bias human perceptual systems toward selective perception of environmental sounds as speech-like, including the calls of other animals. Our view complements cognitive linguistic perspectives on human perception and consciousness by emphasizing the sounds of speech themselves.",

To do so, we ran an online experiment where dyads played a communication game. The degree of shared context that dyads had was varied across three different conditions, and we studied how that affected the amount of lexical variation. We find that lexical variation is affected by shared context: dyads with more shared context maintain more of the lexical variation that is initially present compared to dyads with less shared context. We find that the degree of shared context also affects the lexical preferences of participants: participants with less shared context use iconic strategies that are based on the appearance of stimuli.",

        "summary": "A defining attribute of human language is the seemingly arbitrary association between a word\u2019s form and meaning. We provide evidence that challenges this assumption, and reveals that the meaning of foreign words can be partially deduced based on phonological forms. Monolingual English speakers listened to 45 antonym word-pairs in nine unknown foreign languages and inferred which English configurations corresponded to their meanings. Despite no foreign language experience, participants\u2019 accuracy was higher than chance in each language. Words that shared meaning across languages were more likely to share phonological form. Extraction of meaning from form was predicted by verbal working memory and by how consistently phonological and semantic features of words covaried across unrelated languages. A follow-up study with native Spanish speakers replicated the results. We conclude that sound maps to meaning across a wide range of natural languages with some regularity, and sensitivity to form-meaning mappings indexes broader cognitive functions.",

Our aim is to illustrate the different ways in which genetic research can test and inform theorizing on the evolution of language and speech broadly construed. First, we use a comparative analysis of human vs. primate and archaic human genomes to gain insights into a gene influencing voice pitch in humans. We then present findings on single nucleotide polymorphism heritability of vowel formants which have bearing for the proposal that genetic biases contribute to linguistic diversity. Finally, we test predictions of musical protolanguage accounts, showing phenotypic and genetic correlations between musicality and traits related to speech and language. We conclude with a discussion on the pitfalls and outlook for GWAS in language evolution research.",

Through an appropriate mathematical analysis, we first show that even the most simple reinforcement-learning-based model of communication scales up to the formation of arbitrarily many meaning-signal relationships in populations of any size. We further show that such systems can be built even when agents have no means to determine whether an intended meaning was correctly inferred or not, an ability that is usually assumed to pre-exist. By appealing to cross-situational learning, we show that agents without the ability to communicate referential information can acquire it over time through repeated interactions.",

Understanding the prevalence and mechanisms of this systematicity is crucial to elucidate its roots and role in the emergence of large grammatical and lexical inventories. To address the research gaps of previous studies, which included only a small sample heavily biased towards modern Western European languages, we carried out a more thorough analysis of the prevalence of systematicity by collecting grammatical information from 40 modern and extinct Indo-European languages as well as 20 non-Indo-European languages. Specifically, we examined phonological cues towards grammatical categories of the first phoneme to capture the initial word comprehension advantages of systematicity across languages and their families and understand the evolutionary origins better.",

While people in the Netherlands mainly rely on a relative Frame of Reference (egocentric), Balinese people traditionally use a landmark-based system (geocentric). Here we investigated how spatial information is encoded by participants from these cultures when they can only use silent gesture, thus avoiding a potential direct influence of concurrent spoken language. We also tested if participants would change their strategies depending on aspects of the communicative context. Concretely, participants were asked to produce gestural depictions of spatial arrays in three communicative contexts: non-interactive, interactive, and interactive with ambiguity introduced into the meaning space. A preliminary analysis of the Balinese data showed that participants predominantly used mirror-image depiction or absolute translation, and that the number of incomplete depictions plummeted once an interlocutor was introduced. Our findings shed light on the interplay between culture and communicative setting in the representation and depiction of space.",

Here investigate the manifestation of the principle of compression, namely, the pressure to reduce the duration of vocalizations, in pulsed calls produced by captive killer whales. First, we find weak but significant agreement with a prediction of compression, namely Zipf's law of abbreviation. Second, we measure the degree of optimality of killer whale pulsed call durations using a novel score that indicates that they are 33% optimal. Third, we compare such degree of optimality against the optimality of word durations in human languages (46 languages, 12 families). We find that the degree of optimality of durations in killer whales is smaller than in human languages except for one language. Finally, we investigate the temporal evolution of that optimality. We find no tendency in killer whales: neither towards increasing optimality nor towards decreasing optimality.",

We build linear mixed models with complexity measures like depth of embedding and morphological complexity of words as outcome variables, and an interaction effect of the year of publication and the gender as the explanatory fixed effect. In line with earlier studies, both in sociolinguistics and in evolutionary linguistics, men are found to use more complex language. This, however, is only true for the earlier stages of the corpus. In the course of the 20th century, the gender gap is diminishing. This suggests that cultural factors are at play in what may be in origin an evolutionary evolved difference, as advocated by Miller (2002) and subsequent work.",

Verbs mark two features (subject and event number) with one set of suffixes, such that any suffix can appear in any cell of the paradigm. The high unpredictability of the system is mitigated by a typologically rare constraint: arranging the paradigm cells and the suffixes in one particular order yields a monotonic mapping between the two. We ask how scalar morphology could emerge and be maintained in language change. Using simulation experiments, we test the systemic effects of three models of production, showing that only an analogical model can account for its persistence. Using evidence from internal reconstruction, we argue that the linear ordering of the paradigm cells is a relic of an earlier system in which compositional suffixes marked a single scalar number feature, which is maintained by language change even though its original motivation has disappeared.",

However, speech prosody is involved in the transmission of propositional meaning. Additionally, speech prosody can be transduced into gestures in sign language. Also non-human primates exchange propositional meaning by means of invented gestures and vocalizations, which challenges the hypotheses of a music-like protolanguage. It is proposed that affective prosody, sound symbols, and pantomime were parts of a hominin communicative niche, but none of them were the main precursor of language. Instead, they started to interact in response to selective pressures resulting from increasing social complexity. As a driving force in this process, \u2018neural repurposing\u2019 is proposed. As a result, prosody were repurposed to fulfil new functions in the exchange of propositional meaning e.g. to indicate grammatical mood. Baldwinian evolution could have led to the genetic canalization of the new function of prosody.",

Thus, studying complex interactional abilities in non-human primates helps in understanding communication evolution. The \"social complexity hypothesis for communicative complexity\" suggests that animals in complex social environments also exhibit a complex communication. Here, we study the intra-specific effect of sociality on the complexity of multimodal communicative interactions of a group of 18 captive Guinea baboons. We investigate the impact of dyadic relationships (sexes and interaction frequency) on interaction structure (diversity of units emitted, duration, speed, inter-individual overlap). We show that inter-sex interactions exhibit lower diversity of signals, while male-male interactions present more units per second and more inter-individual overlaps. The less individuals can predict interaction, and the riskier it is, the faster, more compressed and more demonstrative it will be. At the dyadic level, we show an effect of sociality on interactions\u2019 structure.",

However, how do the individual features in a phonological system diachronically behave vis-a-vis a language's overall phonological complexity? This study is concerned with deriving a common phonological  complexity value for each language in a phonological dataset based on their phonological features with computational means. I use deep neural network auto-encoders to construct a computationally-derived latent representation of phonological complexity. Through this process, the model creates a single phonological complexity value for every language based on how predictive each feature is for a language's overall complexity. The resulting distribution of these values has implications for how they and the feature interactions have arisen diachronically. We can compare this latent variable to the per-language sum of all features to see if the model can derive signal from the data. Analysis of this comparison shows that the model picks up on meaningful co-occurrence patterns among the features that influence the overall latent phonological complexity.\nThe main findings of this study are that the phonological features are almost exclusively positively correlated with complexity, meaning that there are no features that are mostly associated with low-complexity languages. Higher phonological complexity in one feature predicts higher phonological complexity in other features.",

These facts influence their study, and motivate evaluation of their framing in language evolution.

        "summary": "A central issue in language evolution is how to explain the apparently constrained\nvariation across the world\u2019s languages. Noun classification systems (gender, noun classes, classifiers) constitute one such case of constrained variation: Some conceptual domains routinely form a basis for classifying nouns, such as animacy. Others, such as colour, do not, even though they are arguably salient in domains like vision. We propose that this is due to a cognitive bias for animacy and/or against colour. Through artificial noun class learning tasks, we show that participants learn animacy-based noun classification better than a colour-based one, and strongly prefer classifying nouns by animacy rather than colour when the input is compatible with both. We also show that participants prefer sorting images than by colour. Taken together, these results suggest that an animacy bias exists, is likely domain-general, and can explain the observed constrained variation in typology.",

Assuming that language has gestural origins, we make the claim that the human brain should be capable of the simultaneous production of two different grammars in two different modalities for the same proposition. We examined this claim through Iranian hearing bimodal bilinguals of Khuzestani Arabic and Sadat Tawaher Sign Language. The findings indicate that the bimodal bilingual brain actively hosts both languages in two different modalities and can produce them simultaneously, providing support for gesture as the first phylogenetic precursor of human language, for its historical connections with speech, and for a single integrated communication system that oversees both vocal and gestural communication. Furthermore, the results show that bimodal bilinguals avoid costly inhibitory control and additional processing costs by taking advantage of the suspension of articulatory constraints.",

For example, VO languages are more likely to have prepositions while OV languages are more likely to have postpositions. Over the past decades, new empirical findings and competing theories have been advanced to explain the word order harmony. These theories range from functional explanations focusing on cognitive and learning biases (Hawkins, 1983; Culbertson, Smolensky, & Legendre, 2012; Futrell, Levy, & Gibson, 2020), to alternative views, emphasizing the roles of cultural evolution and historical accidents in language change (Bybee, 1988; Dunn, Greenhill, Levinson, & Gray, 2011; Cristofaro, 2019). So far, there is little evolutionary evidence favoring or against harmony based on cross-linguistic corpus data, and it remains unclear whether the functional explanations can be reflected in the history of languages.",

This paper explores the application of complex systems theory, as formalized by Thurner, Hanel, and Klimek in their book, \"Introduction to the Theory of Complex Systems\" (2018), to the study of language evolution. Here we show that a simple agent-based model of language evolution that incorporates innovations, combinations, and the social transmission of cultural traits is sufficient to produce a rapid complexification of the linguistic systems in both evolutionary and developmental contexts. A key feature of this model, necessary for the emergence of complexity, is the ability to productively combine and selectively filter out traits. This highlights the importance of combinatorial interactions in the self-organization of linguistic systems. From a developmental perspective, it stresses the importance of acquiring a sufficient number of traits to bootstrap the complexity of natural language.",

Fifty sign-naive hearing English speakers were asked to create sign names for 100 objects for an artificial sign language. Forty-four participants reused earlier created signs in compound names for objects semantically or conceptually related to the earlier meaning. We excluded compounds where one of the signs indicated size or shape and compounds where all signs were unique. This left 1042 responses that were further grouped into sign families based on the reused sign: compound responses that included the same sign were considered a sign family. We identified 266 sign families (mean=5.54 per participant). We speculate that these particular categories all have a prototypical member which can be easily used as part of a compound for other members of the category.",

        "summary": "An important question in the studies of language evolution is whether there are traces of reference in animal signaling behaviors; or if, by contrast, reference is a unique feature of human language. In the literature, there are three main theories which seek to characterize animal signaling behaviors as evolutionary precursors of linguistic reference: the theory of functional reference (Marler et al. 1992), the meaning attribution framework (Wheeler & Fischer, 2012), and the revised version of functional reference (Scarantino, 2013). In this talk, I will start by examining the different ways in which these theories conceptualize animal reference. Then, I will turn to spelling out some limits that these frameworks encounter as accounts of the evolution of linguistic reference. Drawing on studies of chimpanzees and bonobos\u2019 alarm calls, I will propose a novel account for the study of the evolution of linguistic reference.",

Such social networks are characteristic of human communities, and the hypothesis investigated here is that the network structure helps speed up cultural evolution compared to biological evolution. The paper's proposed model adapts a mathematical approach from biology (diffusion models) to this case, and it turns out that this requires the use of a mathematical technique called the fractional derivative. It is shown that the model indeed predicts much higher speed for cultural evolution, and moreover it predicts that the speed of cultural evolution is less dependent on the initial prevalence of an innovation - i.e. innovations tend to spread more quickly in cultural evolution than in biological evolution. The model therefore gives a mathematical underpinning to ideas that were already suspected about cultural evolution.",

Participants reproduced engraved markings dating to ~100.000 BP from the South African Blombos and Diepkloof sites in three conditions of cultural transmission: decoration, identity marking, and communication. Their reproductions were then used as stimuli in five perceptual experiments to investigate differences in their cognitive implications over time and explore similarities with the archaeological record.

In this talk, I offer the first critical appraisal of SPH\u2019s view. I argue that the distinction between \u2018Gricean\u2019 and \u2018Ladyginian\u2019 forms of communication fails to pick out any coherent or non-arbitrary set of communicative behaviours. As a result, it cannot be a useful framework for characterising differences between human and great ape communication, and does not support a plausible account of language evolution. Instead, I argue that we can best accommodate differences between human and great ape communication within the existing 'minimally Gricean' framework (Moore 2017a, 2017b).",

But previous simulation work is mainly either micro-scale or too abstract. Neither pole captures the full range of language dynamics. The aim here is to fill that gap between micro and macro. The simulation combines explicit models for language, demography, and geography in sufficient detail to produce output that in relevant respects mimics real language data, with adequate scale and scope to model language history across millennia.",

        "summary": "Human collective rituals are powerful communicative interactions that foster social assimilation and solidarity (Whitehouse and Lanman 2014; Fischer et al. 2013). They have been thought to have co-evolved with speech, and played a crucial role in the evolution of complex societies (Rossano 2015)Concerning evolutionary precursors, scholars argued that 'rituals' may have evolved from \u2018rule-governed\u2019 communicative exchanges and individualistic and competitive manipulative displays (Knight 1994; Dal Pesco and Fischer 2020). \nThe present paper aims to briefly review the existing body of work on animal interactions with a special focus on ritualized and \u2018rule-governed\u2019 behaviors. Subsequently, it will introduce a newly discovered interaction , \"insect applications\", in chimpanzees in the wild, which are used by chimpanzees to treat their own wounds but also the wounds of other conspecifics (Mascaro et al. 2022). The interactions involve subtle signals such as tactile gestures and gaze alternations and the context of wound tending provides a useful scenario to study the development of socially negotiated signals, context-specific roles, and role-reversal. Wound tending behaviors in chimpanzees may thus provide a useful window onto evolutionary precursors of human communicative rituals, specifically healing rituals, and scenarios of ritual/speech co-evolution (Knight 1998).",

In this study, we investigate whether a form of linguistic cooperation \u2013 structural alignment \u2013 correlates with cooperative behaviour. Some evidence suggests that structural alignment is sensitive to extralinguistic factors such as power or status. The opposite relation remains largely unexplored, though some evidence points to such tendencies: lexical alignment can induce pro-social behaviour. It is therefore probable that similar relations hold between linguistic alignment and cooperative behaviour. This study investigates transcripts from Golden Balls, a TV show in which participants face a prisoner's dilemma scenario at the end of the game. Crucially, the contestants make their choice solely on the basis of prior interaction with other players. The results of our study suggest that participants are more likely to split when their magnitude of alignment is greater.",

We further report\nexploratory findings that gesture-related muscle activations scale with positive peaks in\nthe voice\u2019s amplitude.

To address this gap, we conducted a group communication game in the lab, where micro-societies of four interacting participants developed artificial languages to successfully communicate with each other. Importantly, one participant in the group was assigned a keyboard with a limited inventory of letters, forcing them to communicate differently from the rest. We aim to understand whether the collective language of the group would adapt to the biased minority, or if the majority's language would prevail. Our results suggest that language evolves differently in groups containing participants with different language abilities. Furthermore, some groups adapted to the idiosyncrasies of the biased individuals, suggesting that individual differences can permeate within a linguistic community, ultimately driving changes in languages over time.",

In it, agents learn the language by combining utterances from the previous generation with their inductive biases. Unlike previous IBL models, we include the possibility of imperfect understanding, by which learners may infer the intended function of an utterance incorrectly. This is enough for our model to reproduce the directionality of language change and emerging distributions over grammars that are not uniquely determined by learning biases, features missing from simpler IBL models. Our model is furthermore equivalent to a set of co-evolving Wright-Fisher models, which enables its application to hypothesis testing and model selection in the analysis of corpus data, illustrated by or application to the study of the evolution of relativisers in English. All in all, our model provides insights into the components of cultural transmission responsible for real-world diachronic phenomena.",

One recent study identified non-random vocal combinations in a community of chimpanzees. We followed up on these findings by investigating whether bonobos also combine calls in systematic ways. We conducted 150h of focal recording on 24 adult wild bonobos at the Kokolopori Bonobo Research Project, Democratic Republic of Congo. We showed that bonobos produce non-random combinations more frequently than chimpanzees. Moreover, as observed in chimpanzees, the order of the combinations may be important. Finally, similar to chimpanzees, male bonobos produce more single utterances than females but both sexes produce combinations at similar rates. Overall, our results indicate that the vocal communication of bonobos from the Kokolopori population extensively relies on combinations, to a greater extent than chimpanzees.",

        "summary": "Language and cooperation are tightly linked aspects of human interaction, with language serving as a tool to assess potential cooperation partners. We propose that inter-turn speech pauses, which have essential social-communicative functions, have played a significant role in the co-evolution of language and cooperation. Our experiment investigated how listeners use the duration of these pauses to assess knowledge, confidence, and willingness in conversation partners. We found that long pauses are generally perceived as indicative of lower competence and willingness. However, listeners were more tolerant of long pauses in non-native speakers, interpreting them as the result of prolonged cognitive processing in a non-native language. This pattern was consistent across languages and cultures. Our follow-up study explores whether these relationships persist when participants don't understand the language, supporting the idea that pauses may have been used as early communicative signals before fully-developed shared linguistic systems existed. Additionally, inter-turn pauses may be promising for investigating links between communication and cooperativeness across species.",

On the linguistic level, however, the picture seems to be complicated. Most prominently, Mufwene (2002) has suggested colonialism to have differential effects on the linguistic ecosystem, conditioned by the intensity of colonialism in a region. The goal of this paper is to quantitatively examine to what extent the duration under colonial rule in the history of a country is associated with its present status regarding linguistic diversity. In doing so, we assess different ways of operationalizing linguistic diversity. Controlling for socio-economic covariates, we show that colonization duration increases glottogenetic diversity, but is at the time associated with an increase in language endangerment.",

This trade-off has been appealed to in explaining the relationship between whether a language uses case to mark grammatical role, and whether it has a fixed word order. It has also been shown to be modulated by social biases; speakers are willing to be less efficient to meet a social goal. We expand this research to autistic people, in recognition of the fact that heterogeneity in neurotypes may interact with the kinds of cognitive biases and mechanisms we appeal to in language evolution research. We find that autistic people do adhere to the efficiency trade-off to the same extent as their allistic peers in the absence of a social bias. However, in the presence of a social bias, they are more willing to put in extra production effort to meet a social goal.",

Participants learn a miniature artificial language (non-words with pluralization), and play a director-matcher game with a computer agent (of which the participants are made to believe to be a real person) from either the same or different gender group. From each participant, the personality traits and stereotypes towards different social groups are also elicited. We predict that: (1) people will be more likely to accommodate to members of their own gender group; and (2) the likelihood of participants accommodating to their partners will be correlated with their personality traits and their attitudes/biases (which is also correlated with their gender) towards the social group of their communicative partner.",

        "summary": "Cross-linguistic differences in morphological complexity could have important consequences for language learning. A recent study by Raviv et al. (2021) showed that adults learn highly systematic artificial languages faster and more accurately than semi-, or non-structured artificial languages, suggesting that some languages may be acquired faster than others. However, these findings are limited in two ways. First, they are based only on adult learners, even though children are the most prototypical language learners in real-world situations and may differ in their learning biases from adults. Second, it remains unclear how individual differences in learning-related cognitive capacities such as working memory and selective attention may impact these effects. Addressing these limitations is important for refining theories on language evolution and the origin of linguistic diversity. In this pre-registered study, we therefore extend previous findings to child learners, as well as test for the role of individual differences.",

To bridge this gap, we first explored whether alarm calls elicit referential or emotion-based mental representations in a captive, language competent bonobo. Using a match-to-sample paradigm, Kanzi was exposed to playbacks of conspecific alarm calls where the matching lexigram was either referential (\u2018snake\u2019) or emotive (\u2018scare\u2019). Alarm calls were matched to both labels significantly above chance, suggesting that these calls are associated with both referential and emotional content. Next, we investigated whether bonobos exhibit voluntary control over their call production. We presented wild bonobos with a snake model to assess whether their alarm calls meet criteria for first-order intentionality. Preliminary findings suggest that bonobos can deploy alarm vocalisations in flexible and potentially intentional ways.",

When participants could use their preferred constructions, they chose linguistically similar cooperation partners. But when their language use was restricted, they chose partners that matched their natural preferences, as opposed to their overt constructions.\n\nThis suggests that shared linguistic preferences (alignedness) are potentially more important than adapting to others\u2019 language (alignment) when picking cooperation partners.

We show that two superficially distinct types of sound change, chain shifts and transphonologizations, are also driven by homophony avoidance. Lexical contrast is maintained through both types of change, as the contrast either migrates to a new area within the same phonetic dimension (chain shift), or migrates to a different phonetic dimension (transphonologization). Using a data set of twelve genetically and areally diverse languages, we show that phoneme contrasts having recently undergone chain shifts and transphonologizations are associated with higher numbers of minimal pairs than sets of similar contrasts that have not. These findings support usage-based theories of change in which information-theoretic factors play a fundamental role in shaping languages\u2019 sound systems.",

Such correlations between societal and linguistic features provide a window into linguistic phylogeny.

The sender on a given turn would move their finger around a trackpad to generate colors from a continuous underlying colorspace and select series of them to send. Unlike their original study we manipulated the presence of noise and the presence of a minimum signal length (1 vs. 2 colors). We also manipulated the nature of the underlying colorspace, but differently from Roberts and Clark, 2020, who manipulated the alignment between the demands of perception and production. We found that substantially dispersed systems emerged, but the level of dispersion differed between conditions. Dispersion was also higher when non-signal-initial colors were excluded.",

This follows if sounds are randomly distributed across words. However, this is the opposite relationship we expect in an efficient lexicon. Lexical access proceeds incrementally; if language is shaped to be efficient, we expect the lexicon to share similarities with a Huffman code, producing a negative correlation between the frequency of a sound at a branching point and the number of words it appears in. In an analysis of initial biphones in a corpus of 20 languages, we show that the assumed positive type/token correlation is an artifact of the necessarily positive correlation in the least frequent words. When these are removed, we find the expected negative correlation between a biphone's type frequency and the mean token frequency of the types it occurs in.",

Some of these abilities have been evaluated via novel signaling experiments in which conventional signals are restricted (e.g., Sulik & Lupyan, 2018). Across four experiments, we tested whether knowing interpersonal information, operationalized here as partner age, affects signaling outcomes. We developed a word list with contemporary meanings to determine whether signalers consider age information when generating clue words for specific partners. When informed of a partner\u2019s age (i.e., 18-25 or 40-60) at the task\u2019s onset, we found some audience design evidence (Expt. 1), supporting its potential role in language evolution. When provided with frequent and disruptive reminders of a partner\u2019s age, signalers capitalized on this information more often (Expt. 2-3). Testing signalers\u2019 clues, however, did not yield more success for receivers guessing target words which were produced to be age-specific (Expt. 4).",

Iconicity solves this problem by proposing that similarities between icon and referent could scaffold meaning. This is a seductive proposal, but it assumes that early iconic reference was (1) easy to produce and (2) easy to understand. There is some evidence that iconicity may function this way in adult humans, but iconic reference is not easily understood by either young human children or great apes\u2014both of which have an easier time with conventional symbols. Conventions preceding icons can be seen in the gestures of apes and children, as well as in their abilities to understand gestures and drawings. Symbol-like markings also long predate iconic drawings in the archaeological record. Together, these sources of evidence suggest that symbolism preceded iconic reference in the evolution of language.",

Such a view (mostly) rests on the ostensive-inferential model, which posits that human communication is ostensive, i.e., a process of expression and recognition of 2 types of intention: communicative and informative. Our work deals with the investigation of the nature of mindreading involved in ostensive communication (OC). We are conducting an electroencephalographic study on 30 participants, analyzing Event Related Potentials (ERPs) in response to visual stories representing OC. This study allows us to clarify whether OC requires a higher-order conceptual system for mindreading or a more basic (perceptual-bottom-up) process.",

Could the theories be linked? First, both are associated to increased social tolerance and group structure. Second, certain domesticated species show increased vocal complexity due to changes in stress responses as they become tamed. Vocal learning abilities are observed in various non-human animal groups, including mammals such as elephants, bats, dolphins, whales, seals, and marmosets. In the current study, a cross-species comparison of over 20 domestication traits in vocal learning mammals revealed shared traits like prosociality, exploratory behavior, and play, suggesting that, when taken together, these traits may be linked to the evolution of language.",

Over time, this can result in substantial divergence between the two, as each form of the language becomes better adapted to its own niche. One example of this is the heterographic spelling of homophonous words, such as \u2018knight\u2019 and \u2018night.\u2019 Written wordforms such as these impose additional costs in learning but may be beneficial in reading because they reduce ambiguity. If the benefit in reading outweighs the cost in learning, heterography may be selected for in the evolution of writing systems. We investigate this possibility by experimentally simulating the evolution of orthographic systems using the iterated learning paradigm, and we consider two possible mechanisms by which heterography might emerge, differentiation and conservation. Our findings suggest that communicative pressure for informativeness can give rise to spellings that are more expressive than their spoken counterparts.",

People may differently conceptualize the same objective event and reflect the different conceptualizations in linguistic forms. Thus, the meaning of a form is not uniquely determined by external event. The iterated learning model, a model for cultural evolution of compositional language (Kirby, 2002), does not treat conceptualized meanings since it posits that forms refer to external events. We investigate under what condition compositional language is transmitted when agents can encode their conceptualized meaning. We found that high TopSim did not guarantee stable transmission of compositional conceptualized language. We also observed a sudden decline of TopSim, where agent had linguistic knowledge with weak expressivity and multiple rules for a single meaning-form pair. This means that even if similar meanings are mapped to similar forms, the production processes may largely differ. TopSim cannot represent this difference.",

Experimental semiotics elucidates the processes and necessary requirements for the emergence of a symbolic communication system in interaction. We take an evolutionary perspective to find out what cognitive abilities are essential for successful communication, and to what extent these cognitive abilities are present in animals. By conducting a meta-analysis of existing studies and comparing cognitive abilities across species, we identify common factors like theory of mind and categorical perception and highlight the similarities and differences in these abilities between humans and animals.

This hypothesis, that languages adapt to their social niche, receives some statistical support from typological studies which show negative correlations between number of non-native speakers and morphological complexity. It has also been subjected to experimental tests using artificial language learning techniques, exploring the impact of simplifications made by non-native-like early learners on morphological complexity. Here I report a series of experiments which reconciles an apparent conflict in results reported in the existing experimental literature and indicates that the presence of non-native-like early learners in a population can lead to gradual simplification of morphology.",

Our model inspired by research in artificial intelligence incorporates sequence memory, chunking and schematizing as key domain-general cognitive mechanisms. It combines an emergentist approach with the generativist theory of type systems. By modifying the type system to operationalize theories on usage-based learning and emergent grammar, we build a bridge between theoretical paradigms that are usually considered incompatible. Using a minimal error-correction reinforcement learning approach, we show that our model is able to extract functional grammatical systems from limited exposure to small artificial languages. Our results challenge the need for complex predispositions for language and offer a promising path for further development in understanding cognitive prerequisites for language and the emergence of grammar during learning.",

Here we present an experimental study to investigate the impact of language proficiency and social network structure on language change. We predict that a high proportion of L2 speakers in combination with more fragmented social networks yields higher probabilities of morphosyntactic reduction. We test these predictions in a game-like experiment where high and low proficiency speakers of Dothraki (a constructed language from \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d) take turns describing simple scenes using a chat interface. Participants are organized in micro-societies in four conditions combining two experimental factors: high vs. low proportion of low- proficiency speakers, and densely connected (everyone communicates with everyone) vs. sparsely connected networks (participants only communicate with their close neighbors). The outcome of interest is the morphosyntactic complexity of Dothraki sentences participants send to each other",

For these reasons, the evolution of metaphor and the cognitive processes supporting it are an important explanatory target for evolutionary accounts of human language. Here, we focus on the evolution of one particular capacity supporting metaphor, that of analogy. We integrate data from comparative psychology and cognitive archaeology to investigate the evolution of analogy as well as its evolutionary foundations. We present evidence that many aspects of analogy display evolutionary continuity between humans and non-human animals. In addition, we propose that analogical capacities can also be inferred from the archaeological record by looking at productional diversity in tool-making. Overall, we argue that analogy as an important cognitive process supporting metaphor has deep evolutionary roots.",

This is an ordered continuum of experimental tasks and contexts used in the study of language evolution and other linguistic phenomena. The structure of the scale is based on the amount of innovation that is required to complete the experimental task in a given paradigm. Using a review of existing experimental literature across both phonology and syntax I show that manipulating the amount of innovation required in the experiment reveals a division between the types of cognitive biases which are active at different ends of the scale. This is further strengthened by a new set of artificial language learning experiments that find evidence for different types of cognitive biases in participant's behaviour depending the amount of innovation they have to perform. Finally, I discuss possible parallels between the structure of the scale and theories of language evolution.",

Existing research often cites semiotics experiments where participants communicate more effectively with gestures than vocalizations as evidence of this superiority. However, we argue these experiments are flawed for two key reasons. First, they constrain the use of convention differently in each modality, allowing complete freedom in gesture while restricting vocalization. Second, by isolating vocalizations as purely acoustic and gestures as purely visual, they create an artificial division that favors gestures. We conclude by questioning whether it even matters if gestures are \u201csuperior\u201d to vocalizations in their potential for iconicity. While guessing accuracy may be higher with gestures, semiotics experiments show that vocalizations also afford plenty of iconicity. This raises important questions for understanding the complementary roles of vocalization and gesture in a multimodal evolution of language.",

We present data on the contexts in which high hoots and whistle-high hoots are produced in order to investigate potential shifts in call usage between populations.  \nOur results reveal a significant between-population difference in bonobos\u2019 use of the whistle-high hoot call combination. Bonobos at the Kokolopori field site were significantly more likely to produce the combination upon arrival at a feeding tree, compared to LuiKotale bonobos. This difference may be an example of signal usage optionality\u2013i.e., bonobos in the two populations may use the same signal for subtly different purposes. This variation in the context of call production provides, to our knowledge, some of the first evidence of a capacity for a signal usage adjustment in a wild primate.",

Most sensory categories are additionally used to describe aspects of our social experience with usages that are similar across languages. Here we consider whether the content of these figurative usages is exclusively emotional. We used 99 concepts commonly metaphorized by 54 sensory/spatial adjectives. We measured the emotional content of those concepts using the semantic differential, and then used dual categorization tasks (IATs) to measure human conceptual alignments between concepts (N = 3405). Emotional content strongly predicted alignments, but significant additional alignment was found when two concepts shared a common sensory metaphor.  Sensory metaphor conveys conceptual social information that goes well beyond emotional content.",

Inflection classes, groups of words that are inflected in the same way, help language users to deduce unseen word forms based on the patterns characteristic to the class. To simulate the evolution of inflection classes, one needs a component for their acquisition on the individual level. We model this individual learning task by using an unsupervised Adaptive Resonance Theory 1 (ART1) model, whose level of generalisation can be adjusted with a single parameter. We find a range of generalisation values for which ART1 is able to incrementally learn inflection classes for the Latin present tense. Analysis of the clusters shows a good match between the learned categories and the attested inflection classes. This method could eventually be used as a component in a diachronic model, studying the evolution of inflection classes.",

        "summary": "The perception of musical meter is one of the fundamental rhythmic abilities in humans, though no consistent evidence has been found in non-human animals. We explored the extent to which the basis for meter perception can be found in non-human animals that are not vocal learners, such as the rat. We familiarized 40 na\u00efve rats to auditory rhythmic sequences evoking a metrical structure. Then, we tested whether they could discriminate between familiar and novel sequences on the basis of metrical structures. In a first experiment, we observed discrimination between familiar and novel sequences only when the temporal organization of events differed (isochronous vs. non-isochronous sequences). In a second experiment, rats were able to discriminate sequences with different metrical structures, rhythmic grouping, or ratio. In summary, rats can detect differences between sequences when these are present on a temporal level rather than a melodic or tonal level.",

While the number of terms and which relatives are categorised together varies cross-linguistically, this variation is constrained, and not all theoretically possible categories are attested.\n\nLike other semantic domains such as colour or number, kinship terminology has been proposed to maximise communicative efficiency: extant kinship systems optimally trade off competing pressures for simplicity and informativeness. It has also been suggested that kinship systems are constrained by their evolutionary process, characterised by chains of related changes between similar relatives, which increases system-wide predictability.\n\nHere, we show that kinship terms are highly predictive between two generations of kin, reflected by high mutual information between generations. We propose that predictive structure enables kinship terminology to optimally balance simplicity and informativeness: the more structural information we can generalise, the more resources can be invested in finer-grain distinctions between relatives.",

        "summary": "In this pilot study, we examine whether LLMs can act as controlled variables in experiments on language evolution. Specifically, we assess if linguistic structure evolves when participants (n=10) communicate with a large language model (LLM, text-davinci-003) in the Lewis signalling game. We describe that while participants struggle to learn the initial holistic language, they can correctly label objects after an exposure phase. Yet, using this language for communication proves challenging, with accuracy not improving over rounds. We attribute this to the LLMs' inability to leverage information from past experiences (e.g., (un)successful communication) to update its behaviours. Our results, moreover, show that the evolution of linguistic structure in this collaborative human-machine experiment does not change as radically as in earlier human-only experiments. However, the labelling systems do not completely collapse, which is promising given that experiments with human-human dyads have shown that interaction dynamics and personal differences affect how language evolves. While our work is preliminary and only a first step in human-machine language evolution, it opens possibilities for future work in which one communicative partner can be relatively fixed and kept under experimental control. For example, in more complex setups like iterated learning or by comparing languages from human-human with human-computer experiments to isolate biases of a single human in cooperative settings.",

Such a preference, however, has not been consistently replicated with neural agent simulations. Comparing the behavior of models with that of human learners can reveal which aspects affect the emergence of this phenomenon. In this work, we investigate the minimal conditions that may lead neural learners to develop a DLM preference. We add three factors to the standard neural-agent language learning and communication framework to make the simulation more realistic, namely: (i) the presence of noise during listening, (ii) context-sensitivity of word use through non-uniform conditional word distributions, and (iii) incremental sentence processing. While no preference appears in production, we show that the proposed factors can contribute to a small but consistent learning advantage for DLM in verb-initial languages.",

Recently some cognitive scientists have declared that either impressive LLM performance, or its specific shortcomings, provides compelling new evidence for longstanding debates about domain specificity and innateness of language.

We report tests of a series of Artificial Language Learning (ALL) tasks focusing on training on partial systematic vocabularies with structured meaning spaces followed by test on full vocabulary. Text only models were relatively successful in learning labels for seen items and recalling the meanings of novel words (unseen items). Some multi-modal models had comparable performance for learning labels, but when asked to generate descriptions of images for novel words results were inconsistent.",

We find that the gestural condition was the most communicatively successful, with the vocal and multimodal conditions demonstrating improved accuracy over time.\n\nThe annotation of the gesture condition is still ongoing, therefore here we focus on vocalizations. Regarding iconicity, multiple acoustic features were significantly related to given meanings (e.g., higher pitch for small creatures compared to big creatures). Regarding compositionality, all pairs developed varying levels of compositionality, which increased over time. Together, our results suggest that both iconicity and compositionality can develop in emerging vocal systems.",

While previous discussions focused on cooperative scenarios, this analysis delves into coopetitive situations and their relevance to HLM's evolution. The argument suggests that HLM's emergence is not solely due to optimizing communication for effective cooperation but also stems from the need for epistemic vigilance to ensure cooperation's stability.\n\nThe degree of alignment of interests between individuals becomes a predictive factor. When interests are highly aligned, cooperation is prioritized, emphasizing coordination and relevance optimization. However, in scenarios with lower interest alignment and increased risk of deception or defection, epistemic vigilance takes precedence over relevance optimization.\n\nThis dual-path framework complements existing theories, highlighting the role of cooperation in HLM's evolution. It underscores the importance of cognitive mechanisms for optimizing the effectiveness and stability of cooperation, depending on the degree of interest alignment.",

This study deconstructs the pragmatic capacity into its minimally necessary components \u2013 information sources, and the cognitive capacities enabling access to those information sources. From here, we probe the extent of each capacity in our closest nonhuman relatives, examining to what degree the cognitive underpinnings of pragmatic competence are phylogenetically old, and which ones are potentially human-unique. This study ultimately addresses the challenge of field-specific definitions by suggesting and implementing a simple framework that can be applied comparatively across disciplines and species, fostering a more integrated and interdisciplinary approach to evolutionary pragmatics research.",

        "summary": "Most considerations of the fossil record relevant to human language have relied upon a simplified view of human origins, with Australopithecus, Homo erectus, Neanderthals, and modern humans interpreted as a linear succession. But the fossil record during the last two decades has markedly increased in resolution, including species with small brain sizes that persisted into the later Pleistocene. This study considers the anatomy relevant to vocal communication in Homo naledi. This species had prefrontal lobe anatomy similar to modern humans and other fossil Homo despite having a brain volume between 450 ml and 610 ml. Incus morphology is similar to Paranthropus while other aspects of auditory tract form resemble later Homo when allowing for skull size. The evidence suggests that diversity of anatomy in fossil hominins may have been compatible with complex communication.",

Despite that, studies on perceived facial characteristics, including attractiveness, usually do not provide the readers with a definition of the rated category. Using the deep learning text-to-image model Stable Difusion, we created average visual representations of two distinctive definitions of facial attractiveness: socially and sexually attractive faces. Subsequently, we used tools of landmark-based geometric morphometrics to explore if the visual representations differ across the definitions. The results suggest that the AI-generated representations of attractive human faces are context- and verbal description-dependent and that faces generated with social and sexual attractiveness primes can be distinguished by methods of geometric morphometrics. This result is relevant in the context of links between the perceptual salience of facial characteristics and linguistic expressions referring to these characteristics.",

This capacity is known as functional flexibility and occurs, for example, in speech when a sentence serves different illocutionary forces on different occasions based on changes to visual and intonational cues. Although widely used in human speech, there is a lack of clear evidence for this ability in other species. Here we examined a likely candidate, the Brown-headed Cowbird, which is a vocal learner that develops a multi-song repertoire. Based on extensive observations of this species song use, we provide the first strong evidence of vocal functional flexibility in a non-human animal. These findings indicate that some species may evolve the ability to modulate visual display components and prosody more than vocal presentation per se because a learned phonological system in this and possibly other species is constrained by its vital role as an indicator trait.",

In contrast to Dunbar et al.'s \u224867% of conversational time spent on social topics, our study found that as much as 85% is devoted to social topics. Demographically, females and individuals aged 20\u201324 were particularly active in discussing social topics. Additionally, those with no education and young children without education engaged more in social topics compared to adults with higher education. These findings affirm the importance of social discourse in the emergence of human language, contributing to our understanding of its evolutionary significance.",

        "summary": "Languages exhibit both variation and regularities across domains. A key question in language evolution research is how conventions that exist today arose from early stages of language with motivated variation. We explore this question in the domain of word order. When communicating in the absence of linguistic conventions, participants show a preference for SOV and SVO order for communicating about extensional and intensional events respectively, whereas existing languages are more regular. Priming is seen as a possible force driving regularization. We developed an agent-based model that takes priming and motivatedness as two opposing forces and shows when priming is able to cause regularization of word order. Results show stronger regularization when there is less influence of motivatedness compared to priming, and that variation can be maintained. Looking at social network structures besides fully connected, networks show varying levels of regularization, and even the smallest motivatedness bias can prevent full regularization.",

The flexibility of sound combinations into larger meaningful sequences is one of the hallmarks of human language. To some extent, this has also been found in other species, like chimpanzees and birds. The current study investigates the structure of sounds when speakers are asked to communicate the meaning of 20 selected concepts without using language. Our results show that the structure of sounds between pauses is frequently limited to 1-3 sounds. This structure is less complex than when humans use their native language. The acoustic distance between sounds depends largely on the concept apart from concepts referring to animals, which show a higher diversity of involved sounds. This exploratory analysis might provide evidence of how the structure of sound could have changed from simple to complex in evolution.",

We also found that both systematicity and discreteness emerged and that systematicity was correlated with better communication.\nAdditionally, we note cases where participants seemed to have created composite signals to generalize to unseen colors, inviting speculation about the role of combinatoriality in this domain.\nPossible future extensions of this work are outlined, including investigating the role of discreteness and extending this setup to a multi-generational transmission experiment.",

From evolutionary perspective, it has been proposed that the hippocampus serves as the subcortical hub underlying displacement, which makes human language flexible in time and space. However, very few studies have explored the relation between the developmental trajectory of the hippocampus and flexibility of human language. In this study, by reviewing previous researches, we propose that the emergence of trisynaptic pathway in the hippocampus not only forms the basis for episodic memory but also serves as the milestone for the human language flexibility. We further suggest that the protracted development of such trisynaptic pathway serves as a channel for information exchange between episodic memory and language, and further forms the neurological basis for the domain-general mechanism between them.",

        "summary": "It is currently unknown whether learning pressures of humans are sufficiently reflected in deep neural network models for insights to carry over and to advance theory building. Here, we test deep neural networks on their ability to learn languages with varying degree of compositional structure. We consider both small recurrent neural networks trained from scratch and large pre-trained language models. Ensuring 1:1 comparability to humans, our results show that more compositional structure leads to more systematic, more consistent, and more human-like generalizations to new items. This commonality between humans and machines, combined with other restored language properties facilitated by inductive biases, provides rich implications for using neural networks to simulate the very emergence of language in our species. For instance, our findings lead to the prediction that children would also benefit from more systematic structure for learning, despite substantial differences in learning patterns compared to adults.",

Relative greater use of high cost sounds in potentially information rich positions results in a more balanced range of sound contrasts, creating a higher entropy lexicon . Here we show that higher-cost sounds are preferentially allocated to two distinct, high information positions: positions early in the word, and syllables with stress. We tested this in a set of nine genetically diverse phonemically transcribed languages coded for stress. As a proxy for resource-cost, we used average type frequency of phonemes across languages. As predicted, we find a highly significant relationship between inventory probability and syllable number, and between inventory probability and stress: both positions are enriched for high cost sounds, creating a locally higher entropy system in positions where the most information can be conveyed.",

In this poster, we propose to look at the existing anatomical and material culture evidence about the cognitive capacities of Homo heidelbergensis and compare it with what is known about Neanderthals in order to understand what capacities necessary for language were already present in their ancestors. It\u2019s argued that the difference between the cognitive capacities of Neanderthals and their ancestors is rather a matter of degree, and to the extent that this is indicative of language, to get to the origins of language, maybe we should take another step back in time and turn our attention to these earlier populations.",

To this end, we introduce a novel paradigm for evaluating the iconicity of productions at the level of individual referent features. Vocal and gestural signs referring to unfamiliar, multi-dimensional stimuli were created by 18 dyads playing an emergent communication game in VR. In an online experiment using our new paradigm, na\u00efve participants (N=1200) are then tested for guessing accuracy on these productions. \n\nWe predict that (I) iconicity will be present in both gestures and vocalizations, but stronger in gestures; (II) iconicity trajectories over the course of dyadic interaction will differ across modalities; and (III) some features will be better guessed in gestures, with others guessed well across modalities. Preliminary data shows that gestures are indeed guessed better than vocalizations, particularly for features like shape and motion.",

The underlying mechanism has been attributed to the idea that semantic changes inevitably occur over time (i.e., words do not stop changing in meaning even when it already has several senses). However, evidence from those studies falls short of fully supporting what the purported mechanism entails, as those studies focused exclusively on non-obsolete senses in non-obsolete words. A comprehensive test of the predictions of the diachronic mechanism requires evidence that the reported positive correlation extends to obsolete words, and that the correlation holds when obsolete senses are also counted. This study provides that missing piece for the puzzle. Examining over 36,000 English verbs, we show that longer lifespan correlates with a greater number of changes/senses in obsolete as well as non-obsolete words, though the effect is stronger in non-obsolete words.",

In the presented study, we investigate experimentally whether the emergence of distributional structure can be driven by domain-general constraints on sequence learning over repeated language transmission. I will show evidence of the emergence of statistically coherent units and their skewed frequency distribution in a non-linguistic iterated learning experiment. Doing so, I will contrast different strategies to extract units from sequence-sets. Taken together, the experimental results suggest that learning pressures can shape the distributional structure of language and with that, that aspects of linguistic structure may emerge independently of the structure in the meanings that are being conveyed.",

        "summary": "Facial expressions are essential to human social communication. Their origins and functions, however, are topics of debate within evolutionary theories. Darwin suggested these expressions evolved from sensory-regulating facial movements. Building on this, we analyzed facial movements from two studies where Western and East Asian participants categorized facial animations by basic emotions and conversational messages (e.g., happy or confused). Results showed that expansion facial movements, like raised eyebrows, predominantly signify high arousal and positive messages, whereas contraction movements, like squinting, typically indicate negative messages. Interestingly, these facial cues also influence spoken language perception; for example, expansive movements convey confidence and larger quantities, while contractions suggest doubt and smaller amounts. Despite cross-cultural differences in emotion expression, these systematic expansion and contraction patterns remain consistent. Our findings indicate that these biologically-driven movements are foundational for the development of semantic and pragmatic facial signals that could have supported the early multimodal beginnings of language.",

English-speaking participants were asked to learn novel words (pseudo-words) in different co-occurring contexts (taxonomic, thematic, and neutral), and their similarity biases were measured over the learning process for each word group and across groups. Context exposure increases similarity biases for the matching context. Learned similarity biases persisted to novel lexical items.

        "summary": "Is there a cognitive bias against absolute synonymy? Roberts & Altenhof (2023) explored this question, exposing participants to two novel verbs that they then generalized to positive or negative contexts. Despite identical distributional information during this exposure, participants differentiated the words by context, treating them as non-synonymous. Altenhof & Roberts (2023) took these results as potential evidence for a cognitive bias against synonymy. However, there was substantial variation in participants' responses\u2014the degree to which participants treated the words as having different meanings. The present paper expands on this work, applying an iterated learning paradigm, which can amplify weak cognitive biases. Unlike prior work on iterated learning (Smith & Wonnacott, 2010), we found that transmission did not reduce unpredictable variation. We discuss these results alongside ongoing work to replicate the study with additional controls and the implications of this work on understanding individual differences in statistical learning.",

One important feature of these systems is their combinatorial structure: the reuse of building blocks to compose new concepts or ideas. Here, we conduct a study that combines iterated learning with a communication game to show that combinatorial structure is not inevitable, but rather arises as a trade-off between the simplicity of signals and the amount of information they convey. Our results provide additional insights into the role of communication in the emergence of signal structure, as a force that maintains complexity and creates alignment. These results validate a key theoretical prediction about how combinatorial structure arises in the interplay of learning and use, and shed light on how signaling systems such as language have become such efficient and flexible tools in human cognition.",

This study explores training populations of communicating agents, constructed with different pretrained image-encoding network architectures, on a referential communication task. The focus is on how population heterogeneity shapes the developed visual communication protocol. Particularly, we are interested in the iconicity and symbolicity aspect of the graphical communication protocol developed by heterogeneous populations versus homogeneous pairs. Preliminary results show that training such agent populations is more difficult and does not yield task success as often as homogeneous pairs. However, the stochastic nature of the population interactions seems to influence the sketches produced by population agents to become more iconic than their homogeneous counterparts.",

In 2010, Lupyan & Dale's provided the first large-scale test of the hypothesis various formulated by Trugill, Wray & Grace, McWhorter, and others that there may be a link between some aspects of linguistic complexity and the \"niche\" in which a language is learned and used. Confirming some of those predictions, Lupyan & Dale showed that language spoken by larger groups tend to have less complex morphology. Recently, Shcherbakova et al. (2023) conducted a meticulous analysis of the link between grammatical complexity and sociodemographic factors and came to a very different conclusion, finding either no link or a positive relationship between complexity and population size. They concluded that \u201csocieties of strangers\u201d (i.e., larger languages and those with more nonnative speakers) \u201ddo not speak less complex languages\u201d. In this work we undertook a careful re-analysis to better understand what accounted for the qualitative difference between earlier work and Shcherbakova et al.\u2019s (2023) results.",

However, laughter is also a pre-linguistic signal that is homologous to the play vocalizations of the other great apes. Thus, laughter presents an intriguing case in which a pre-linguistic vocalization became integrated into the language system. To better understand this relationship, we conducted a systematic review of human laughter and animal play. Acoustic signaling during social play is extensive across the animal kingdom. We discuss the forms and possible functions of these signals, as well as the unique features of human laughter. We argue that further research on laughter and animal play vocalizations is critical for our understanding of the ways that language co-evolved with existing vocal repertoires in our evolutionary ancestors.",

What are the evolutionary pressures that drove the development of referential vocalization? In this project, we explore the survival costs and benefits of referential alarm calls in a savanna-dwelling primate. We base our model on the discovery that the African vervet monkey (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) gives acoustically different alarm calls to different predators, conditional on context. In the following, we simulate the costs that vervets incur by monitoring their environment for predators, issuing alarm calls, running to escape potential predators, and foregoing foraging in favor of seeking refuge, and track the survival outcomes. Our goal is to determine the envelope of evolvability of representational signaling in the parameter space of a troop of primates in an African savannah environment.",

Surprisingly, the obvious answers to this seemingly simple question, e.g., that frequent words reflect greater communicative need, are either wrong or incomplete. We show that a word's frequency is strongly associated with its position in an association-based semantic network. More centrally located words are more frequent. But is a word's centrality in a network merely a reflection of inherent centrality of the meaning the word denotes? Through cross-linguistic comparisons, we found that differences in the frequency of translation-equivalents are predicted by differences in the word's network structures in the different languages. Specifically, frequency was linked to how many connections a word had and to its capacity to bridge words that are typically not linked. This hints that a word's frequency (and with it, its meaning) may change as a function of the word's association with other words",

The bird successfully learned to distinguish patterns of the form A-B-A from e.g. A-A-B, and further probe testing showed that it was correctly recognizing the intended pattern rather than relying on other cues.

        "summary": "Successful communication is thought to require members of a speech community to learn common mappings between words and their referents. But if one person's concept of CAR is very different from another person's, successful communication might fail despite the common mappings because different people would mean different things by the same word. Here we investigate the possibility that one source of representational alignment is language itself. We report a series of neural network simulations investigating how representational alignment changes as a function of agents having more or less similar visual experiences (overlap in ``visual diet'') and how it changes with exposure to category names. We find that agents with more similar visual experiences have greater representational overlap. However, the presence of category labels not only increases representational overlap, but also greatly reduces the importance of having similar visual experiences. The results suggest that ensuring representational alignment may be one of language's evolved functions.",

Research attempts to elucidate the origins of diversity and universals (e.g., the Acoustic Adaptation Hypothesis ) and universals (e.g., the Efficient Communication Framework). This article aims to integrate these theories within a complex adaptive systems (CAS) account by comparing existing agent-based models (ABMs) of human vowel systems and cetacean vocal systems. These ABMs illustrate sound system evolution as a process of self-adaptive optimization. Diversity arises from differences in adaptation strategies across environments, while universals stem from common conditional constraints and specific goals (e.g., communicative for humans and biological for non-human animals). It can uncover generalizable principles underlying the emergence of diversity and universals in language evolution by comparing ABMs of human and cetacean sound systems. Such cross-species comparisons offer insights into the social-cognitive mechanisms driving language evolution and the perpetuation of endless change.",

We investigate whether the distinction between principled and statistical properties can be learned from language itself. If so, it raises the possibility that language experience can bootstrap core conceptual distinctions and that it is possible to learn sophisticated causal models directly from language. We find that language models are all sensitive to statistical prevalence, but struggle with representing the principled-vs-statistical distinction controlling for prevalence.

Recently, such differences have been explored through the lens of differences in the frequencies with which certain concepts are employed in discourse. In this paper, I depart from such work by suggesting that it is not merely the frequency of usage, but also the way in which concepts are used that explains whether languages group together two concepts with a single lexical item. I provide a theoretically grounded account of why we should expect this to be the case, and develop a methodology for operationalizing such ideas in a multilingual corpus, finding that variation in the discursive practices of using words indeed predicts whether languages co-express concepts or split them.",

All logically possible behaviors are represented in our data: some participants prefer Cue A, some prefer Cue B, and some form a more holistic representation of Cue A+B. Despite this diversity, the population as a whole was above-chance when generalizing to novel stimuli, suggesting that redundancy helps people converge on similar surface structures, even if their underlying representations differ.",

On the Leipzig view, gestural forms are ontogenetically ritualised from action sequences between pairs of individuals. On the St Andrews view, gestures are the product of natural selection. The Leipzig view predicts within- and between-group differences that arise as a product of learning in ontogeny. The St Andrews view predicts universal gestural forms comprehensible within and between species. We reject both of these accounts, and propose an alternative \u2018recruitment view\u2019 of the origins of great ape gestures. According to the recruitment view, great apes communicate by presenting \u2018naturally meaningful\u2019 (Grice 1947) bodily states, which inherit their communicative functions from a visual resemblance to easily recognisable bodily states and action schemas. We locate great ape gestural communication within a pragmatic framework that is continuous with human communication, and make testable predications for adjudicating between the three views.",
